# Coffee Block

## Inspiration

Coffee Block was born out of our passion for crypto and coffee! We want to create a project that allows crypto coffee lovers to support small scale farms and producers.

## What We Learned

As blockchain development students, Chainlink Black Magic 2024 Hackathon was our first. We had to read up on CCIP and thanks to the Chainlink Bootcamps done in January and April, we had a basic enough understanding to pursue with the project. We had to learn and put to practice the following for the hackathon:

Smart Contracts + Solidity
Frontend connection with the backend
To get CCIP to work

## How We Built Coffee Block

Coffee Block was built using a combination of smart contracts and a user-friendly web interface. We utilized Chainlink's CCIP to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain transactions. The frontend was developed using React, while the backend services were implemented with Node.js and Express.

## Challenges Faced

One of the major challenges we encountered was ensuring the interoperability of different blockchain networks. Integrating Chainlink's CCIP required thorough testing and validation to ensure seamless cross-chain transactions. We had to change our initial idea and do a workaround. So there will be room for improvement after the hackathon.

## Telegram Group

We would like to improve this further and are open for suggestions and disucssions. Here's our [Coffee Block Telegram group](https://t.me/+yHxclZ9JCyQ1ZjFk)
